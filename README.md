### Currently working on reasoning processes for open-source language agents âš¡

- Collaborating with iGavroche and [paolorechia](https://github.com/paolorechia) on [BrainChulo]( https://github.com/ChuloAI/BrainChulo) a local GPT chat like tool.
- We're focused on setting up LTM for local LLMs to enable reliable, fact-based interactions with language agents.
- My research focuses on a the QA process using [Microsoft guidance language](https://github.com/microsoft/guidance).
- Building on the work of, namely, [Jason Wei ](https://github.com/Timothyxxx/Chain-of-ThoughtsPapers) and [Shunyu Yao](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm/blob/master/fake.png) I'm currently writing a paper on a crossover "Train of Thoughts" approach that draws heavily from cognitive psychology.
